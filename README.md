<center><h1>Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe</h1></center>

<center><p>This is the ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe Game developed by Ahbab Ashraf and Anthony Hom</p></center>

<p>Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is a game composed of two players. Both players can select a certain sized board to play on.<br>
	In order to play, one of the players must be designated as Player 1 for X and the other as Player 2 for O.<br>
	The bottom of the board will determine which player's turn it is and keep track of scores between the two players.<br>
	To win the game you must click on the buttons of the board and achieve "size" in a row of X's / O's (ex: 4 in a row for a 4 X 4 board)</p>

<h2>Working features:</h2>
<p>Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe currently has the Startup GUI running, transition between players,<br>
	clearing the board, selecting the different sized boards, and choosing names.</p>

<h2>List of unresolved bugs</h2>
<p> The terminal gets flooded by "errors" when you click buttons, but the game is uneffected. </p>

<h2>How to run the code!</h2>
<p>To run the code, go to the files containing this project. <br>
	Type: javac StartupGUI.java <br>
	Then java StartupGUI </p>

<center><p> 	You will need two players for this game! Select the size board and type in your names for Player 1 and Player 2. <br>
				Start the game and get to smashing those buttons to get the designated amount in a row and you'll win! 
				The bottom of the board will tell you which player's turn it is and how many each player has won! </p></center>
